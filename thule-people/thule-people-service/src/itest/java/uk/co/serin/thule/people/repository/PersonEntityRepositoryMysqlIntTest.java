     * Flyway is used to apply the sql migration scripts. However, Flyway will fail to connect to the Mysql database if the database has not been started.
     * Ideally the mysql docker container would be started via a @BeforeClass annotation, a constructor or static initializer. However, the outer test class
     * is not loaded until after the spring context has been initialized via the Junit SpringRunner, by which time the spring application context,
     * which includes the Flyway spring bean, has failed. Although the Spring application context has failed to initialize, the SpringRunner will continue
     * to try to run the tests.
     *
     * One option is to ignore this and when the the SpringRunner tries to run a test (i.e. after executing the @BeforeClass method),
     * it will recognise that their is no Spring context and create another one (in the same way that an application context is re-created when using the
     * @DirtiesContext annotation). This time it should succeed because the Flyway spring bean will be able to connect to the mysql database which has
     * been started via the @BeforeClass. The downside to this approach is that it can be very slow having to create another application context
     *
     * Another option is to provide Spring with a ApplicationContextInitializer to start the mysql docker container, which is executed after the context
     * has been created but not yet initialized, i.e. no Spring beans have yet been created. This way, when the SpringRunner tries to run the tests,
     * it already has an application context running. This is the approach taken here and is a performance improvement which can save considerable
     * developer time.

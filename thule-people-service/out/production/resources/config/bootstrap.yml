# Spring server configuration
# By default, tomcat will listen on port 8080 and will be restarted once the config has been read from the config service.
# Unfortunately, when multiple spring cloud services are starting at the same time in the same container (e.g. when testing),
# they will all try to use port 8080 until they have been restarted following a config refresh. To overcome this,
# port 0 (i.e. random unused port) will be used until the config has been refreshed and the correct port used.
